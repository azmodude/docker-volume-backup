# volume-backup

An utility to backup and restore [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume/). 

**Note**: Make sure no container is using the volume before backup or restore, otherwise your data might be damaged.

## Backup

Syntax:

    docker run -v [volume-name]:/volume -v [output-dir]:/backup --rm loomchild/volume-backup backup [archive-name]

For example:

    docker run -v some_volume:/volume -v /tmp:/backup --rm loomchild/volume-backup backup archive1

will archive volume named `some_volume` to `/tmp/archive.tar.bz2` archive file.

## Restore

- **Note**: This operation will delete all contents of the volume
- **Note**: The volume to be restored needs to be created first (`docker volume create <volume>`)

Syntax:

    docker run -v [volume-name]:/volume -v [output-dir]:/backup --rm loomchild/volume-backup restore [archive-name]

For example:

    docker run -v some_volume:/volume -v /tmp:/backup --rm loomchild/volume-backup restore archive1

will clean and restore volume named `some_volume` from `/tmp/archive.tar.bz2` archive file.

## Wrapper scripts

`bin/backup.sh` and `bin/restore.sh` are little wrapper scripts that simply invocation and also check for existing/in-use volumes and act accordingly.
